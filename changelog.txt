 - PDF output support
    - Uses same routes as DWF plotting, except a pdf extension is used instead of dwf
        - The pagewidth and pageheight parameters have been replaced with papersize parameter, which can be any value of: A3,A4,A5,Letter,Legal
    - Additional support for producing layered PDF output from a session-based map
 - #59: Feature query routes (selecting features) no longer require authentication challenge
 - #26: Output feature query response content as we iterate through the reader
 - Ant build system support. Phing still required for API doc generation.
 - "features" representation support for routes to Layer Definitions. Includes pre-eval'd tooltip and hyperlink values for each feature if specified.
    - GET /library/{resourcePath}.LayerDefinition/features.{type}
 - External libraries no longer included in source. Checkout footprint is significantly reduced. Developers are expected to use PHP Composer to pull in these libraries after checkout. Does not affect release archives.
 - Improved GeoJSON output
    - Features with single identity properties will have that property written out as the "id" attribute
 - Improved tile cache resiliency
    - Failed tile rendering requests can be retried up to a certain limit before bailing out with an error.
 - New/updated samples
    - Cesium example consuming GeoJSON served by mapguide-rest
    - New ol3 sample with dynamic GeoJSON vector layers
